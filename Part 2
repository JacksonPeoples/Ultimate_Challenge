1. I would choose profit as the key metric. Ultimately, if reimbursing tolls increases rides but not enough to cover the cost of the tolls, then it is not worth it. Net profit captures the effectiveness.

2. I would, for the next 3 months, randomly pick 50 percent of drivers to offer reimbursement to. This would allow Ultimate to compare the profits generated by those drivers against those not offered reimbursement. This method is preferrable to randomly allotting days for reimbursemnt or simply reimbursing for a few months because it allows Ultimate to track the effectiveness of the strategy over time. It allows Ultimate to account for overall trends and cyclicality. It's possible that it's only worth it to reimburse on weekends and not weekdays (or vice versa) due to the differences in weekday/weekend riders' habits. I would then take the overall profits of each group and perform a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis being that there is no difference in profir generated.
